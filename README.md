# Assembly Maze Game

## Overview

The Assembly Maze Game is an interactive game developed in Assembly language. This project demonstrates the application of low-level programming techniques to create a functional and engaging maze game. It aims to showcase the capabilities of Assembly language in handling graphics, user input, and game logic.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Navigate through the maze using keyboard controls.
- **Dynamic Maze Generation**: The maze layout is generated dynamically to offer a unique experience each time.
- **Real-time Rendering**: Efficient rendering of the maze and player movement for smooth gameplay.
- **Obstacle and Goal Management**: Various obstacles and a defined goal to challenge the player.

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Assembly (specific assembly language used, e.g., x86 Assembly)
- **Assembler**: (Specify the assembler used, e.g., NASM, MASM)
- **Platform**: (Specify the platform, e.g., DOS, Linux)
- **Algorithms**: Implementation of maze generation algorithms, collision detection, and user input handling.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - An assembler like NASM or MASM.
   - An emulator or environment that supports Assembly language execution (e.g., DOSBox for DOS programs).

2. **Instructions**:
   - Clone the repository:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Assembly_Maze_Game.git
     cd Assembly_Maze_Game
     ```
   - Assemble the code:
     ```sh
     nasm -f bin maze_game.asm -o maze_game.bin
     ```
   - Run the game:
     - Using DOSBox:
       ```sh
       dosbox maze_game.bin
       ```
